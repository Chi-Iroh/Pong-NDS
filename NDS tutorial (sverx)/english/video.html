  <h2>Nintendo DS 2D Graphics</h2>
  <hr>

  <h4>Graphics Engines</h4>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Nintendo DS is equipped with two separate LCD screens, both with a resolution of
    256x192 pixels, capable of displaying images in up to 262 thousand colors (18 bpp, bits per pixel). It has two
    distinct graphics engines, each connected to a single screen at a time. Only one of the two engines has 3D graphics
    capabilities (referred to as the <em>MAIN engine</em>), while both have almost identical capabilities for 2D
    graphics. You can choose how to associate the two graphics engines with the two LCD screens. For example, the
    <em>MAIN engine</em> can generate 3D/2D graphics on the upper screen while the other engine, the <em>SUB
      engine</em>, produces 2D graphics on the lower touch screen, or vice versa.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">The functions defined by <em>libnds</em> (in <code>system.h</code>) that operate on
    this association between engines and screens are:
  </p>

  <p><code>void lcdMainOnTop(void)</code></p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">which links the output of the main engine to the upper screen and the output of the
    secondary engine to the lower screen, and:</p>

  <p><code>void lcdMainOnBottom(void)</code></p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">which, vice versa, links the output of the main engine to the lower screen and the
    output of the secondary engine to the upper screen. Finally, there is the almost useless</p>

  <p><code>void lcdSwap(void)</code></p>

  <p>which swaps the current screen association.</p>

  <hr>

  <h4>2D Graphics Modes</h4>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">Each of the Nintendo DS graphics engines has the ability to work with backgrounds in a
    certain number of distinct modes, categorized into two groups: <em>text</em> modes and <em>bitmap</em> modes. The
    <em>MAIN engine</em> also has a <em>direct</em> mode.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">In the <em>direct</em> mode, called <em>Frame Buffer</em>, you can directly set the RGB
    values (red, green, blue) of each pixel on the screen. In this mode, the image can display up to 32768 different
    colors simultaneously (15 bpp), but it requires 96 KB of video memory, considering the screen size (256x192 pixels)
    and the fact that each pixel requires <em>two</em> bytes of video memory. In this mode, the graphics engine is
    bypassed, and therefore none of its features, such as sprites, can be used.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">In <em>bitmap</em> modes, you can set for each pixel on the screen a color chosen from
    a palette of 256 colors. This palette is defined in a dedicated memory area, where each color is defined by an RGB
    triplet. This way, each full-screen image can display up to 256 different colors simultaneously, but it only
    requires 48 KB of video memory since each pixel requires only <em>one</em> byte. It is also possible to use
    <em>bitmap</em> modes with 32768 colors, which are somewhat similar to the <em>direct</em> mode but are still
    managed by the graphics engine, which is not bypassed in this case.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">Both <em>text</em> and <em>bitmap</em> modes have four overlaid screens (the
    <em>backgrounds</em>), with the ability to define which pixels should and should not be drawn, allowing you to see
    the underlying backgrounds through the overlaying ones. Some backgrounds can be scrolled horizontally and vertically
    (<em>scrolling</em>) or even rotated, enlarged, or reduced (<em>rotation and scaling</em>), depending on the mode
    being used.
  </p>


  <p style="text-align:justify;">Finally, each graphics engine, in addition to the aforementioned modes for backgrounds,
    can handle sprites. Each engine can handle up to 128 sprites, ranging in size from the smallest definable, 8x8
    pixels, to the largest of 64x64 pixels. However, we will discuss sprite management in more detail later.</p>

  <p>To activate the desired graphics mode, <em>libnds</em> provides us with the following two functions, also defined
    in <code>video.h</code>:</p>


  <p><code>void videoSetMode(u32 mode)</code></p>

  <p><code>void videoSetModeSub(u32 mode)</code></p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">which, respectively, activate the desired mode on the main or secondary graphics engine
    and also specify which other features we want to use. For example, we could request that only two of the four
    backgrounds be active, that sprites be active and the 3D graphics engine be turned off, and that extended palettes
    be used for both backgrounds and sprites. Purely as an example.</p>

  <h4>Video Memory</h4>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">Before delving into the details of graphics usage, it is necessary to understand the
    functioning of the Nintendo DS video memory. The console is equipped with a total of 656 KB of dedicated video
    memory, divided into 9 banks of different sizes and functionalities. All these banks have a few things in common:
    for example, they all have access to 16 bits for reading and writing, which is important to keep in mind because to
    change the value of a byte or nibble in this memory, you must first read the halfword (16 bits) that contains it,
    modify the desired part, and finally rewrite the entire halfword. Attempts to write directly to bytes in this memory
    are ignored, so care must be taken, or it will be as if no write operation was performed. These 9 banks, by
    convention, are indicated by the letters A to I, and of these, the first 4 (A, B, C, D) are also called the main
    banks and have a size of 128 KB each, while the subsequent banks have various sizes ranging from 16 KB to 64 KB.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">What may seem complicated, and indeed is a bit, is that some banks can be used with one
    graphics engine and not the other, or they can be dedicated to certain functions while other banks are not, and some
    functions can be performed by one bank or another while in certain cases, for certain functions, there is one and
    only one bank that can be used. Sometimes this may involve wasting a certain amount of memory, or, conversely,
    having to give up certain functionalities or limit them. Or it may even be necessary to reconsider the associations
    between banks and the functions assigned to them... all of this, fundamentally, because a bank cannot perform two
    functions at the same time.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">Let's get into details: in addition to the 4 main banks, which as we said are also the
    4 largest, each having a size of 128 KB, we still have bank E, with 64 KB, banks F and G, both with 16 KB, then H
    with 32 KB, and finally the last bank, I, with 16 KB.</p>

  <p>The different functions that can be assigned to the banks are:</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">- LCD (no function): the bank is mapped to a fixed address, different for each, in
    order to compose a single continuous block of memory, if needed. All banks are capable of working in this mode.<br>
    - Texture memory: the bank is used as memory for textures that will be used by the 3D engine, evidently only of the
    main engine since the secondary engine does not have 3D capabilities as already mentioned. Only the 4 main banks (A,
    B, C, D) are able to perform this function.<br>
    - Palette texture memory: the bank is used as memory for the palettes (color palettes) of textures, for those
    textures that need them. Only banks E, F, and G are able to perform this function.<br>
    - Main engine Background memory: the bank is used as memory for the backgrounds (regardless of how many will be
    used) of the main engine. Possible with all banks except the last two, H and I.<br>
    - SUB engine Background memory: the bank is used as memory for the backgrounds of the secondary engine, similarly to
    what happens with the MAIN engine. This mode is possible only on banks C, H, and I.<br>
    - Main engine Sprite memory: the bank is used as memory for the sprites of the main engine. Only on banks A, B, E,
    F, and G.<br>
    - SUB engine Sprite memory: the bank is used as memory for the sprites of the secondary engine. Only banks D and
    I.<br>
    - Memory for the extended palettes of the main/sub engine backgrounds/sprites (all 4 modes are distinct): we will
    talk about extended palettes later, for now, be satisfied with knowing that on the Nintendo DS, it is possible to
    declare up to 16 palettes (of 16 or 256 colors) for each background and up to 16 palettes for sprites. For each of
    the two engines, obviously.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">The functions defined by libnds in the <code>video.h</code> file to set the operating
    modes of the banks are the following:</p>


  <p><code>void vramSetBankA(VRAM_A_TYPE a)</code></p>

  <p><code>void vramSetBankB(VRAM_B_TYPE b)</code></p>

  <p><code>void vramSetBankC(VRAM_C_TYPE c)</code></p>

  <p><code>void vramSetBankD(VRAM_D_TYPE d)</code></p>

  <p><code>void vramSetBankE(VRAM_E_TYPE e)</code></p>

  <p><code>void vramSetBankF(VRAM_F_TYPE f)</code></p>

  <p><code>void vramSetBankG(VRAM_G_TYPE g)</code></p>

  <p><code>void vramSetBankH(VRAM_H_TYPE h)</code></p>

  <p><code>void vramSetBankI(VRAM_I_TYPE i)</code></p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">As a parameter, each accepts a member of an enumeration defined specifically for each
    bank, given the different functionalities of each bank. In addition to the aforementioned functions, the following
    functions are also defined, which can be useful:</p>

  <p><code>u32 vramSetMainBanks(VRAM_A_TYPE a, VRAM_B_TYPE b, VRAM_C_TYPE c, VRAM_D_TYPE d)</code></p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">Sets the properties for the 4 main banks (A, B, C, D) and returns the value of the
    previously active modes in the aforementioned banks. These modes can then be quickly restored with the following
    function:</p>

  <p><code>void vramRestoreMainBanks(u32 vramTemp)</code></p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">The following table summarizes the possible modes for each bank, using the libnds
    enumerations that can be used with the aforementioned functions to activate the requested modes.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">(*) The list is not exhaustive. There are other values in the enumerations defined by
    libnds, but they are not related to other graphical modes but simply to the association of memory addresses for
    various banks. We will not discuss the topic for now.</p>

  <p>For the complete list of enumerations defined by libnds, covering all possible modes of video memory usage, see <a
      href="vram_modes.html">Table 1:<strong>All video memory modes</strong></a>.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;"><sup>(1)</sup> In reality, this specific enumeration has never been defined in
    <em>libnds</em>. However, the I bank can be used for the SUB engine backgrounds, so it seemed appropriate to include
    it.
  </p>

  <h4>Using the <em>Frame Buffer</em> Mode</h4>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">As we mentioned earlier, one of the possible graphical modes is the <em>Frame
      Buffer</em>, the ability, limited to the <em>MAIN engine</em> only, to directly control the intensity of red,
    green, and blue for each pixel on the screen. On the Nintendo DS, it is possible to activate one of four <em>Frame
      Buffers</em>, numbered from 0 to 3, and each of these uses one of the main video memory banks as associated
    memory. Therefore, <code>MODE_FB0</code> uses bank A, <code>MODE_FB1</code> uses bank B, <code>MODE_FB2</code> uses
    bank C, and finally, <code>MODE_FB3</code> is associated with bank D. This allows for the implementation of simple
    animation techniques: using two <em>Frame Buffers</em>, for example, you can draw a frame without displaying it
    until it is complete, and then, once the complete frame is shown, erase and redraw a new frame on what was shown
    before. This technique is called <em>Double Buffering</em>, and if the swap is done at regular intervals between one
    frame and another, it can work very well. This is what was done, for example, on a PC when graphics cards did not
    have 2D/3D acceleration capabilities: behind the scenes, everything was erased and redrawn from scratch, pixel by
    pixel, each time.</p>


  <p style="text-align:justify;">In the following example, we will use a <em>Frame Buffer</em>, number 0, configuring
    video memory bank A in the correct way, the LCD mode, to create a small program that draws a white pixel where the
    user presses with the stylus.</p>

  <pre>#include &lt;nds.h&gt;

    int main(void) {

      // set video memory
      vramSetBankA(VRAM_A_LCD);
      
      // set framebuffer mode 0 on the MAIN engine
      videoSetMode(MODE_FB0);
      
      // associate the MAIN engine with the lower screen, the touchscreen
      lcdMainOnBottom();
      
      while(1) {
      
        // read the state of keys and the touch screen
        scanKeys();
        
        // are we pressing on the touch screen?
        if (keysHeld() & KEY_TOUCH) {
    
          // read the stylus position
          touchPosition touch; touchRead(&touch);
          
          // place a white pixel where it was pressed
          VRAM_A[touch.py * SCREEN_WIDTH + touch.px] = RGB5(31, 31, 31);
        }
          
        // wait for the next vertical blank
        swiWaitForVBlank();
      }
    }
    </pre>

  <p></p>

  <h4>Bitmap Modes</h4>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">Unlike the previously mentioned <em>Frame Buffer</em> mode, which works by directly
    using the entire screen, the <em>tiled</em> and <em>bitmap</em> modes operate on <em>backgrounds</em>. As we've
    mentioned earlier, it's possible to have up to 4 backgrounds simultaneously on each screen. Therefore, it's
    conceivable to have both <em>tiled</em> and <em>bitmap</em> backgrounds simultaneously. Before delving into
    <em>bitmap</em> backgrounds specifically, let's clarify how to activate the famous 4 backgrounds.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">There are 6 distinct modes, all functioning equally on both graphics engines, differing
    only based on the functions available for the 4 backgrounds. Each background can simply be of type
    <strong>text</strong>, or <strong>rotational</strong>, or finally of type <strong>extended</strong> (the full name
    would be <strong>rotational extended</strong>, for brevity, we will simply call it <strong>extended</strong>), and
    it's only this last type, the <strong>extended</strong> type precisely, that allows the <em>bitmap</em> mode. The
    following table details how the 4 backgrounds will work in the 6 possible modes, with the names of these modes as
    defined by <em>libnds</em>.

  <p style="text-align:justify;">(*) When activating the 3D engine, background 0 is "handed over" to 3D graphics and
    used exclusively by it. Only on the MAIN engine, of course, as we have seen.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">In the mentioned modes, we are not really obligated to use all 4 backgrounds, and in
    fact, if not specified otherwise, none of the backgrounds will be activated. So when declaring how we will operate,
    we must remember to activate the backgrounds we want to use, similar to when we want to use sprites, for example, or
    extended palettes.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">We also need to mention that, as hinted at the beginning, it is possible to have bitmap
    modes with 256 and 32768 colors. To select our preferred one, we don't have to change the graphics mode, just change
    the mode on the background. For this, libnds has defined constants (in <code>background.h</code>) to easily access
    the control registers of the backgrounds and set the desired modes. The main registers to control the 4 backgrounds
    on the MAIN engine are, respectively, <code>REG_BG0CNT</code>, <code>REG_BG1CNT</code>, <code>REG_BG2CNT</code>, and
    <code>REG_BG3CNT</code>, while on the SUB engine they are <code>REG_BG0CNT_SUB</code>, <code>REG_BG1CNT_SUB</code>,
    <code>REG_BG2CNT_SUB</code>, and <code>REG_BG3CNT_SUB</code>. Bitmap modes on extended backgrounds allow the use of
    bitmaps of 4 different sizes (128x128 pixels, 256x256 pixels, 512x256 pixels - the only non-square, and finally,
    512x512 pixels) for each of the two possible color depths, generating 8 possibilities that are defined in libnds, in
    <code>background.h</code>, as follows:
  </p>

  <p>256 colors (8 bpp):</p>

  <p><code>BG_BMP8_128x128<br>
BG_BMP8_256x256<br>
BG_BMP8_512x256<br>
BG_BMP8_512x512</code> (requires 256KB of video memory)</p>

  <p>32768 colors (15 bpp):</p>

  <p><code>BG_BMP16_128x128<br>
BG_BMP16_256x256<br>
BG_BMP16_512x256</code> (requires 256KB of video memory)<br>
    <code>BG_BMP16_512x512</code> (requires 512KB of video memory)
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">For completeness, it is worth mentioning that in reality, the MAIN engine still has a
    graphics mode in which the 4 distinct backgrounds disappear, and only a single background remains in bitmap mode
    (called Mode 6 or also large bitmap mode) that allows bitmaps of size 1024x512 pixels or 512x1024 pixels at 256
    colors (8 bpp). The mode in question is defined in libnds as <code>MODE_6_2D</code> and the bitmaps, controlled
    through the background 2 register, <code>REG_BG2CNT</code>, are defined as follows:</p>


  <p><code>BG_BMP8_1024x512</code> (requires 512KB of video memory)<br>
    <code>BG_BMP8_512x1024</code> (requires 512KB of video memory)
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">In the following example, we will use background 3 (<strong>extended</strong>) of mode
    4 (mode 3 or mode 5 wouldn't have made a difference anyway) of the SUB engine to draw a white pixel where the user
    presses with the stylus, similar to the previous example. Note, however, that in this example, we will use the
    secondary graphics engine and memory bank C set in <em>background</em> mode (and not bank A since it cannot work as
    a <em>background</em> for the SUB engine, as we have already mentioned). Regarding the rotation/scaling matrix we
    will refer to: we will discuss it later when we address the topic of <strong>rotational</strong> backgrounds.</p>
  <pre>#include &lt;nds.h&gt;

    int main(void) {

      // set video memory (bank C)
      vramSetBankC(VRAM_C_SUB_BG);
      
      // set mode 4 on the SUB engine
      // and activate background 3
      videoSetModeSub(MODE_4_2D | DISPLAY_BG3_ACTIVE);
      
      // set BG 3 to 256x256 mode at 16 bpp
      // and specify the starting address in memory for the bitmap
      REG_BG3CNT_SUB = BG_BMP16_256x256 | BG_BMP_BASE(0);
      
      // 'reset' the rotation/scaling matrix for background 3
      REG_BG3PA_SUB = 1 << 8;
      REG_BG3PB_SUB = 0;
      REG_BG3PC_SUB = 0;
      REG_BG3PD_SUB = 1 << 8;
      
      // associate the MAIN engine with the upper screen
      // so the SUB engine will be associated with the touchscreen
      lcdMainOnTop();
      
      while(1) {
      
        // read the state of keys and the touch screen
        scanKeys();
        
        // are we pressing on the touch screen?
        if (keysHeld() & KEY_TOUCH) {
         
          // read the stylus position
          touchPosition touch; touchRead(&touch);
          
          // place a white pixel where it was pressed
          BG_GFX_SUB[touch.py * SCREEN_WIDTH + touch.px] = RGB5(31,31,31) | BIT(15);
        }
    
        // wait for the next vertical blank
        swiWaitForVBlank();
      }
    }
    </pre>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">There are at least three differences that immediately catch the eye in this example,
    compared to the previous example, the one with the <em>Frame Buffer</em>. The first is that when setting the
    <em>bitmap</em> mode for background 3, we also had to tell it where, in the video memory assigned to backgrounds,
    the <em>bitmap</em> we want to display begins. This is because, obviously, the same video memory bank can be used
    not for a single background but for all, capacity permitting. Therefore, information specifying where the
    <em>bitmap</em> starts, in steps of 16 KB, must be provided for each background.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">The second difference is that to turn on a pixel this time, we don't write to the
    address of memory bank C but to a specific address (<code>BG_GFX_SUB</code>—its counterpart for the <em>MAIN
      engine</em> is <code>BG_GFX</code>) associated with the address of the memory for the backgrounds of the SUB
    engine. This has the advantage that if, in the future, we decide to use another memory bank instead of bank C, we
    wouldn't need to modify this reference in the code. Finally, it should be noted that when we told the memory bank to
    work in a mode other than the LCD mode, this bank will no longer be accessible at the address where it would have
    been reachable otherwise. This, of course, applies to all video memory banks, and later on, we will see that in some
    modes, the video memory banks will not be mapped to any address, making it impossible to write to them.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">But let's not anticipate this for now, and instead, let's point out the last of the
    three differences: this time, in addition to giving the pixel to be drawn the white color (in 15 bits), we also had
    to turn on the most significant bit of the <em>halfword</em>. This bit is the alpha channel (transparency), and it
    has two values, each associated with a simple meaning: if it's 1, the pixel should be drawn; if it's 0, the pixel
    should not be drawn, and therefore, the underlying backgrounds can be seen through this background. This is a
    possibility that the <em>Frame Buffer</em> does not have.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">One last consideration, valid for both <em>bitmap</em> type backgrounds, which we have
    just written about, and for <em>text</em> type backgrounds, which we are about to describe: in all modes that use
    palettes (so both 16-color and 256-color modes), pixels defined with color 0 (zero) will not be drawn if there are
    other active backgrounds behind the one we are drawing on. This is because otherwise, it would never be possible to
    see the other backgrounds through this one, making the other backgrounds practically useless. However, we will
    return to this topic at the end of this document.</p>

  <h4>Tiled Modes</h4>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">The 'tiled' modes are by far the most used modes for their significant memory savings
    and high efficiency for programs that use them. Memory savings come from the continuous reuse of the same 8x8 pixel
    tiles, which will always occupy the same amount of video memory regardless of how many times this tile will then be
    displayed on the screen. It is possible to use up to 1024 different tiles per background if it is in
    <strong>text</strong> or <strong>extended</strong> mode. Each tile can also be displayed flipped horizontally
    (<em>mirror</em>), i.e., with all the pixels in each row drawn in reverse order from right to left, or flipped
    vertically (<em>flip</em>), i.e., with all the pixels in each column drawn upside down. It can also have both
    characteristics simultaneously. In <strong>rotational</strong> mode, neither <em>mirror</em> nor <em>flip</em> are
    possible, and the maximum limit of usable tiles is 256.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">To use these modes, it will be necessary to distinguish, in the video memory reserved
    for backgrounds, an area where to deposit the tiles and an area where to deposit the maps that describe how the
    tiles will be positioned to compose the background. Background maps in <strong>text</strong> mode can have
    dimensions of 32x32 tiles (generating a 256x256 pixel background), or 64x32 or 32x64 tiles. In any case, these are
    actually two maps of 32x32 tiles placed side by side or overlapping, or we can have a map of 64x64 tiles, actually
    using 4 adjacent maps of 32x32 tiles each. In <em>libnds</em>, these modes for <strong>tiled backgrounds</strong> in
    <strong>text</strong> mode are defined as follows:
  </p>

  <p><code>BG_32x32<br>
    BG_64x32<br>
    BG_32x64<br>
    BG_64x64</code></p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">For <strong>extended</strong> type backgrounds, it is possible to use maps starting
    from the size of 16x16 tiles (512 bytes in size in video memory, generates a 128x128 pixel background) up to 128x128
    tiles (32 KB occupied by the map, generates a 1024x1024 pixel background). However, this time, these are represented
    in memory as a single map, making their use immediate. In <em>libnds</em>, these modes for <strong>tiled
      backgrounds</strong> of type <strong>extended</strong> can be used through the following definitions:</p>

  <p><code>BG_RS_16x16<br>
    BG_RS_32x32<br>
    BG_RS_64x64<br>
    BG_RS_128x128</code></p>


  <p>Which are the same ones we will use for <strong>rotational</strong> type <em>tiled backgrounds</em>. To choose the
    color depth for the tiles of <strong>text</strong> type backgrounds, the following constants are defined:</p>

  <p><code>BG_COLOR_16</code><br>
    <code>BG_COLOR_256</code>
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">These select, respectively, as you might guess, the tiles with 16 colors (4 bpp, so
    each <em>halfword</em> contains 4 pixels) and those with 256 colors (8 bpp, 2 pixels per <em>halfword</em>).
    However, these constants should not be used for <strong>extended</strong> type backgrounds: these can exclusively
    use tiles with 256 colors. But what are these colors from which we can choose our 16 or 256? In any 16- and
    256-color graphical mode (so also in 8 bpp <em>bitmap</em> mode), the color of each pixel is actually the index of
    an element in the palette, and each of the two graphic engines of the Nintendo DS has a separate palette for
    backgrounds and one separate from the previous one for sprites, in addition to the extended palettes we will talk
    about later. (All these palettes are stored in a memory area specifically dedicated and not part of the 9 video
    memory banks). Each element of the palette is a <em>halfword</em> that defines the color in 15 bits in a way
    completely analogous to what was done in the direct video mode of the <em>Frame Buffer</em>. The four standard
    palettes are defined by <em>libnds</em> as vectors, each of 256 elements, with the following names:</p>

  <p><code>BG_PALETTE<br>
    SPRITE_PALETTE<br>
    BG_PALETTE_SUB<br>
    SPRITE_PALETTE_SUB</code></p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">So, to use a <strong>text</strong> graphical mode, we will need to perform at least the
    following operations:</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">- Set a video memory bank for the backgrounds.<br>
    - Set a graphic engine in a mode between mode 0 and mode 5 and activate at least one background.<br>
    - Load 8x8 pixel tiles into video memory, paying attention to color depth (16-color tiles occupy 32 bytes each,
    while 256-color tiles occupy 64 bytes each)<br>
    - Load into the palette of the backgrounds of the graphic engine in use all the colors that will be used by the
    tiles.<br>
    - Load at least one map for the tiles into video memory, using the defined tiles.<br>
    - Set the selected background in the correct mode, according to the map dimensions and the number of colors.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">In the example, we will use the <em>MAIN engine</em> to display a small square near the
    center of the touchscreen, using graphical mode 0 and background 1 in 16-color text mode, with a 32x32 tile map. We
    will try to move the square by following the stylus dragged on the screen.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">Now let's clarify some details. The first one is related to the <code>swiCopy()</code>
    function. This function uses procedures that copy data from one location to another among the various console
    memories; it's not a fast procedure, but it's very convenient because it handles the 16-bit write required by the
    video memory autonomously, even though the function specifies the number of bytes to be copied. It doesn't matter,
    but remember that in our case, the function will not copy 32 bytes but 16 <em>halfwords</em>. Obviously, unless you
    want to copy an odd number of bytes, in which case the operation would fail.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">Another detail is how video memory is used; as easily understood, in our memory bank,
    we will store both the tiles and the maps we will use to create our backgrounds, so we must be careful not to
    overwrite the maps with the tiles or vice versa. Since each map occupies 32x32 for 2 bytes = 2 KB, then with each
    increment of <code>BG_MAP_RAM</code> and <code>BG_MAP_BASE</code>, we will move forward by 2 KB. Still, it is
    possible to use up to only 32 maps, so we must necessarily limit ourselves to the first 64KB. Similarly, with each
    increment of <code>BG_TILE_RAM</code> and <code>BG_TILE_BASE</code>, we move 16 KB forward, so by skipping the first
    block, as we did in the example, we have left the first 16 KB free to be sure not to overwrite the map at the
    beginning of the memory.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;"><code>REG_BG1HOFS</code> and <code>REG_BG1VOFS</code>, on the other hand, are the two
    <em>write-only</em> registers (that is, it is only possible to write to these registers but not read their value)
    that allow horizontally and vertically translating (<em>scrolling</em>) the background, in this case, background 1.
    They only work with <strong>text</strong> type backgrounds and do not work with <strong>rotational</strong> or
    <strong>extended</strong> types, which have other registers to perform these and even more complex operations.
    Perhaps you have also noticed that the little square that disappears from the right reappears on the left and vice
    versa: it is the effect of the <em>wrapping</em> of the background, and it cannot be turned off in
    <strong>text</strong> mode. Vertically, however, the square that disappears at the bottom does not immediately
    appear from the top and vice versa: this is because the background is taller than the screen (256 pixels in height
    of the background versus 192 pixels in height of the screen), so the <em>wrapping</em> is not immediate.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">The last detail is that you can use up to 1024 tiles maximum even though each element
    of the map is actually 16 bits, and to represent numbers between 0 and 1023, 10 bits are sufficient. All this
    happens because the 6 most significant bits of each element in the map are reserved for special functions such as
    extended <em>palettes</em>, the first 4 bits, and the remaining two bits are precisely those which, if set, activate
    respectively the <em>mirror</em> (10th bit) and the <em>flip</em> (11th bit) of the tile. In <em>libnds</em> (in
    <code>background.h</code>), the two convenient constants are defined:
  </p>

  <p><code>TILE_FLIP_H</code><br>
    <code>TILE_FLIP_V</code>
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">So to display a tile <em>tess</em> in a way that it appears flipped both horizontally
    and vertically, we need to calculate the value to be inserted into the map with the formula:</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;"><code>(tess & 0x03FF) | TILE_FLIP_H | TILE_FLIP_V</code></p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">As we have written before, only <strong>text</strong> and <strong>extended</strong>
    type backgrounds use this 16-bit system with 1024 possible different tiles. <strong>Rotational</strong> type
    backgrounds, on the other hand, use only maps with 8-bit elements and can therefore have a maximum of 256 distinct
    tiles and are devoid of <em>mirror</em> or <em>flip</em> capabilities or extended <em>palettes</em>. Moreover,
    <strong>rotational</strong> type backgrounds like <strong>extended</strong> types only support tiles with 256
    colors, while <strong>text</strong> type backgrounds also support tiles with 16 colors.
  </p>

  <h4>Rotational Backgrounds</h4>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">Lastly, let's talk about <strong>rotational</strong> backgrounds, all in all, the least
    interesting since a kind of 'economical version' of <strong>extended</strong> backgrounds, as everything that can be
    done with a <strong>rotational</strong> background can be done equally with an <strong>extended</strong> background.
    These can be useful only if you want to save video memory since the maps of <strong>rotational</strong> backgrounds
    are smaller, at the cost, however, of less flexibility. As mentioned earlier, with <strong>rotational</strong>
    backgrounds, we are limited to a maximum of 256 distinct tiles, we will not have the possibility of horizontal or
    vertical flipping of the tile, and we cannot even use extended palettes. Additionally, <strong>rotational</strong>
    backgrounds, like <strong>extended</strong> types, only support tiles with 256 colors, while <strong>text</strong>
    type backgrounds also support tiles with 16 colors.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">As in all <em>tiled</em> modes, here too, we will have to define maps in which we will
    describe the position of each tile. As in <strong>extended</strong> mode and unlike <strong>text</strong> mode, in
    this mode, maps start from a smaller size, 16x16 tiles (256 bytes in size in video memory, generating a background
    of 128x128 pixels), and go up to 128x128 tiles (16 KB occupied by the map in video memory, generating a background
    of 1024x1024 pixels), but without being represented as maps of base size side by side, so their use will be
    immediate.</p>

  <p>The constants defined by <em>libnds</em> for <strong>rotational</strong> backgrounds are as follows:</p>

  <p><code>BG_RS_16x16<br>
      BG_RS_32x32<br>
      BG_RS_64x64<br>
      BG_RS_128x128</code>
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">There is still one bit that is extremely important: a bit that activates the
    <em>wrapping</em> of the background. When <em>wrapping</em> is deactivated, if the background is smaller than the
    screen, we will see only a part of the screen occupied by the background; otherwise, the entire background will be
    repeated above and below and to the right and left as many times as necessary to fill the entire screen. It can be
    useful to obtain various graphic effects of interesting impact. <em>Wrapping</em> can be activated or deactivated
    through the constants:
  </p>

  <p><code>BG_WRAP_ON<br>
      BG_WRAP_OFF</code>
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">as usual, defined in the <code>background.h</code> file. However, be careful, these
    flags can only be used with <strong>rotational</strong> or <strong>extended</strong> backgrounds;
    <strong>text</strong> type backgrounds, on the other hand, have <em>wrap</em> active by default and cannot be

  <p style="text-align:justify;">In the following example, we will use the <em>SUB engine</em> to display a
    <strong>rotational background</strong> in the center of which we will draw two blue squares and two red crosses. By
    dragging the stylus on the screen upwards or downwards, we will force the resizing (<em>scale</em>) of the
    background, while dragging the stylus right and left will force the rotation (<em>rotation</em>) of the background
    clockwise or counterclockwise. Finally, by holding down one of the two shoulder buttons on the Nintendo DS (L and R
    buttons), we will activate <em>wrapping</em> to observe the effect it produces.

  <p style="text-align:justify;">It is necessary to clarify how the rotation and scaling of <em>rotational
      backgrounds</em> are controlled. <em>Rotational backgrounds</em>, like <em>extended backgrounds</em>, each have 4
    registers assigned to a rotation/scaling matrix. Each of these values is a signed number expressed in fixed-point
    notation with an 8-bit fractional part. If you are not familiar with fixed-point numbers, you can try to imagine
    that the number is a signed integer expressing how many times a fixed fraction must accumulate to find the resulting
    value. The fraction is 1/2<sup>(fractional part bits)</sup>, so in our case, having 8 bits in the fractional part,
    it will be 1/2<sup>8</sup> = 1/256. So, when writing into each register, we must express the values in 256ths of an
    integer, and that's why to set the value 1, we need to write exactly 256 (precisely that <code>1 << 8</code> seen in
    the code).</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">According to the specifications, to obtain the values to be inserted into the four
    registers to achieve a rotated background by <em>x</em> degrees and scaled by <em>m</em>, you need to set the
    values:<br>
    PA = <em>m</em> cos (<em>x</em>) ; PB = - <em>m</em> sin (<em>x</em>) ; PC = <em>m</em> sin (<em>x</em>) ; PD =
    <em>m</em> cos (<em>x</em>) . PA and PD are set to the same value (and PB and PC exactly opposite) only because we
    are using the same scale for both vertical and horizontal scaling. Otherwise, if we want to distinguish the two
    scales, <em>mx</em> and <em>my</em>, for example, to have distortions, we would have:<br>
    PA = <em>mx</em> cos (<em>x</em>) ; PB = - <em>mx</em> sin (<em>x</em>) ; PC = <em>my</em> sin (<em>x</em>) ; PD =
    <em>my</em> cos (<em>x</em>) .
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">If you prefer to avoid trigonometry, you can see the matrix in the same way the
    graphics engine sees it: starting from each pixel on the screen (and not from the <em>background</em>), you will
    calculate which pixel of the <em>background</em> should be drawn. To do this, you will calculate the next pixel to
    be drawn through the aforementioned matrix, interpreting the 4 registers as follows:<br>
    PA = horizontal increment (x) on the background for each pixel horizontally (x) on the screen<br>
    PB = horizontal increment (x) on the background for each pixel vertically (y) on the screen<br>
    PC = vertical increment (y) on the background for each pixel horizontally (x) on the screen<br>
    PD = vertical increment (y) on the background for each pixel vertically (y) on the screen<br>
    So at this point, if you have understood everything, it should also be clear why the identity matrix (which displays
    the <em>background</em> on the screen without rotation or scaling) is PA=1; PB=0; PC=0; PD=1.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">In addition to these 4 registers for each <em>rotational background</em> (or
    <em>extended background</em>), there are still 2 offset registers that allow you to move the origin of the
    <em>background</em> where desired, and they have names defined in <em>libnds</em>. In our example, where we use
    <em>background</em> 3 of the <em>SUB engine</em>, the registers are <code>REG_BG3X_SUB</code> for horizontal offset
    and <code>REG_BG3Y_SUB</code> for vertical offset. For other <em>backgrounds</em>, we will have similar names (the
    digit inside the name changes), and we should use those without the <code>_SUB</code> suffix when we want to refer
    to the <em>backgrounds</em> of the <em>MAIN engine</em>.
  </p>

  <h4>Background Priorities</h4>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">It has been mentioned that in <em>tiled</em> and <em>bitmap</em> modes, it is possible
    to activate up to all 4 <em>backgrounds</em> simultaneously, and that by using color 0 for <em>tiled</em> modes or
    using the alpha bit for <em>bitmap</em> modes, it is possible to define which pixels should be drawn and cover what
    is drawn behind, and which pixels should not be shown on the <em>background</em>, allowing you to see what is
    displayed on a lower <em>background</em>. Normally, <em>backgrounds</em> are superimposed in the standard order,
    i.e., <em>background</em> 0 is on top of <em>background</em> 1, which is in front of 2, and <em>background</em> 3 is
    therefore the farthest background possible. Fortunately, this setting is not fixed; otherwise, there would be no way
    to have a <em>bitmap</em> type <em>background</em> (e.g., <em>background</em> 2 in mode 5) in front of all others,
    unless you keep the two upper <em>backgrounds</em> turned off. Instead, through the use of priority, you can
    redefine (even dynamically, if desired) the order of <em>backgrounds</em> by assigning a value between 0 and 3 to
    each: the smaller this value, the higher the priority of the <em>background</em>, and therefore it is shown in
    front. When priorities are the same, the previous principle still holds; the <em>background</em> with a smaller
    number will be drawn in front while all others behind, in order. Therefore, in <em>libnds</em> (in
    <code>background.h</code>), the following macro is defined:
  </p>

  <p><code>BG_PRIORITY(n)</code></p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">which can be used for this purpose. For example, to give the highest priority to
    <em>background</em> 2 and be certain that <em>backgrounds</em> 0 and 1 are definitely drawn behind 2, you could use
    the following code:
  </p>
  <pre>REG_BG2CNT |= BG_PRIORITY(0);
REG_BG0CNT |= BG_PRIORITY(1);
REG_BG1CNT |= BG_PRIORITY(1);</pre>
